# Perpetual-Lending


# Lending Protocol

Welcome to the Lending Protocol - a decentralized, blockchain-based lending platform built on Ethereum. Our protocol allows users to create, manage, and interact with loans in a secure and transparent manner.

## Features

- **Loan Creation:** Users can create loans with specified terms.
- **Interest Payments:** Borrowers can pay interest on their loans.
- **Default Management:** Automated checks and handling for loan defaults.
- **Security:** Built with Solidity and includes security features to prevent common vulnerabilities.
